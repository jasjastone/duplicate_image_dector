# Duplicate Detector
This is an ai model that can be train based on the images you have on your server.
Then using the trained data you can check if the user is trying to upload duplicate or similar image.

## Why using this method of removing duplicated
1. You may need to have only original image of the user that has first uploaded.
2. For removing duplicates ðŸ˜„ `obviously`
3. Add the uniqueness of the users images
4. Flexibility for detecting duplicate without the need of looping through the directories while the user is uploading their image

## What is this not for
1. Secure or dectetor for NFTS
2. Checking duplicated based on the image name or path

# If you like it give it a star to the repo so that other people can find it
#Licensing
## The code you can modify it on your own terms no license or attribution(if possible will also be nice ðŸ¤ª) is required to use it
